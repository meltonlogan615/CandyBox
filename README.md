# CandySite
 Candy Exploration
 Central repository for packaged candies.
 
 File Organization:
 CandyBox = All html files
 CandyBox/explore = country specific folders. (Within folders, house img files?)
 CandyBox/images = Almost all image files
 CandyBox/js = All .js files
 CandyBox/python = Repo for .py files if ever used 
 CandyBox/snippets = code not used, but could be useful later
 CandyBox/stylesheets = All CSS & SCSS (once I learn that jazz)
 
 # Candy Box file formatting and naming conventions:
 outside of .js files and attributes used by .js files
 all files names should be lower case
 all .html files will be single names, if one or more words are used, seperated by "-", as in "contact-us.html"
